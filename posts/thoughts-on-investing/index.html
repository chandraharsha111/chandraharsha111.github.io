</code></pre></div><p>Investing can simply be put as a process in which upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and adequate return. For anyone looking into investing understanding available categories, before you start thinking about choices available within those categories could help with rate of return expectations and stay rational. Broadly speaking I think most investors have these following options</p>
<ul>
<li>Commodities</li>
<li>Productive assets</li>
<li>Anything denominated in a currency</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Commodities</strong>: Gold, Silver
This category relates to items that don&rsquo;t produce anything but you expect that some one will pay you more later on. classic case for it is gold. This may be a decent inflation hedge, however you could be speculating(Bitcoin) with these sort of assets.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes">Keyenes</a> decribed it as picking what you think that other people would pick in a beauty contest rather than picking the most beautiful women among the group.</p>
<p><strong>Currency Denominated Investments</strong> - Bonds, Money market funds, Bank deposits, Cash
All most all of the major currencies have declined in value over time with inflation. So unless we are getting paid exteremly well for having them, holding this class of investments do not make much sense to me. Mostly this asset class produces lower returns with lower risk. But, <em>its not the case always</em></p>
<p><strong>Productive assets</strong> - Fram land, Business, House
In this category, you decide how much to pay for the asset based on what the asset itself will produce. There is some logic to this. For example when you buy an acre of land - you can expect the farm to produce certain average yield over a period of few years. You can roughly calulate cost of tenant farmer, taxes etc to determine the cash it can deliver to you.</p>
<p>There can be some years where you could be affected by drought etc, there will some great years where the yield is high due to improvement in farming equipment.</p>
<p>Some people can even speculate on these sort of assets - stock traders. However, when you look historically productive assets resulted in greater returns to other two categories. So even when you are investing having this approach of looking at what the business does few years from now can help investors to be rational.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">If you find my basic reasoning sensible, let me go further to classify investors based on the amount of time they have to look for investment opportunities. 
   - Active Investor 
   - Passive Investor
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Active Investor</strong>:
It refers to an investment strategy that involves ongoing buying stocks or businesses upon thorough analysis, monitoring its growth to exploit decent profits. An active investor will have to sell his investments even at a loss when expectations for the business change. Examples include companies like Dexter Shoes, Movie Pass</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">Accounting is the language of business, so I expect active investors to be well versed with it. 
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/activeinvesting.asp">Investopedia</a></p>
<p><strong>Pasive Investor</strong>: For some one that is not having significant amounts of time to do thorough analysis to evaluate businesses, Indexing investing provides the simplicity these investors need.  Moreover, it is self cleansing, by which I mean that these investors need not worry about analyzing companies. Comanies can be added and removed from the index based on performance at a very low fee. Looking at history, I feel this is what most people should focus on and just move on with things that they are intersted about in life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesimpledollar.com/investing/what-is-index-investing-and-why-does-it-work/">Index Investing</a></p>
<p>I believe investing is too important for most people to ignore since it has the power to change peoples lives.</p>
