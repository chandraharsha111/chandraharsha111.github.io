One of such  examples is Gold. If we consider all of the Gold in the world, its about 7.5 trillion. That accounts to owning total farmland in the United States(2.7 trillion) + 14 percent of all the stocks in the USA  + 1 trillion of walking money or cash in ones pocket. Choose productive assets over unproductive assets are inevitably beneficial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGold may be a decent inflation hedge, however you could be speculating(hoping that other people will more tomorrow for the asset we hold). \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes\"\u003eKeynes\u003c/a\u003e described it as \u0026ldquo;picking what you think that other people would pick in a beauty contest rather than picking the most beautiful women among the group\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther commodities like oil and cotton certainly have utility for humans.

So unless we are getting paid extremely well for having them, holding this class of investments do not make much sense.

For example when we buy an acre of land, we expect the farm to produce certain average yield over a period of few years.  There can be some years where the owner could be affected by drought etc, there will be some great years where the yields would be decent(based on several factors like better farming equipment or infrastructure etc). Investors can roughly calculate maintenance costs, taxes etc to determine the cash the farm can deliver to the owner. Our job as an investor is take this into account and pay a fair price for a successful investment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen investing in stocks having this approach of looking at what the business does few years from now can help investors to be rational in mindset.

If a\ncompany still does not expense options, or if its pension assumptions are fanciful, watch out. When managements take the low road in aspects that are visible, it is likely they are following a similar path behind the scenes. There is seldom just one cockroach in the kitchen.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTrumpeting EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a particularly pernicious practice. Doing so implies that depreciation is not truly an expense, given that it is a “non-cash” charge. That’s nonsense. In truth, depreciation is a particularly unattractive expense because the cash outlay it represents is paid up front, before the asset acquired has delivered any benefits to the business. Imagine, if\nyou will, that at the beginning of this year a company paid all of its employees for the next ten years of their service (in the way they would lay out cash for a fixed asset to be useful for ten years). In the following nine years, compensation would be a “non-cash” expense – a reduction of a prepaid compensation asset established this year. Would anyone care to argue that the recording of the expense in years two through ten\nwould be simply a bookkeeping formality?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSecond, unintelligible footnotes usually indicate untrustworthy management. If you can’t\nunderstand a footnote or other managerial explanation, it’s usually because the CEO doesn’t want you to. Enron’s descriptions of certain transactions still baffle me.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFinally, be suspicious of companies that trumpet earnings projections and growth expectations.

Lou is a top-notch investor with an outstanding long-term record of managing GEICO’s equity portfolio. But he is only six years younger than I.

And here a confession is in order: In my early days I, too, rejoiced when the market rose. Then I read Chapter Eight of Ben\nGraham’s The Intelligent Investor, the chapter dealing with how investors should view fluctuations in stock prices. Immediately the scales fell from my eyes, and low prices became my friend. Picking up that book was one of the luckiest moments in my life.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMany years ago Ben Franklin counseled, **“Keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep thee.”**Translating this to our regulated businesses, he might today say, “Take care of your customer, and the regulator – your customer’s representative – will take care of you.” Good behavior by each party begets good behavior in return\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBerkshire’s newer shareholders may be puzzled over our decision to hold on to my mistakes.

If either of the failings we set forth in Rule 11 is present – if the business will likely be a cash drain over the longer term, or if labor strife is endemic – we will take prompt and decisive action.

If we do so, Berkshire’s share price, though unpredictable from year to year, will itself outpace the S\u0026amp;P over time. If we fail, however, our management will bring no value to our investors, who themselves can earn S\u0026amp;P returns by buying a low-cost index fund.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e12 Billion Heinz purchase with another running partner,\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCharlie and I believe it’s a terrible mistake to try to dance in and out\nof it based upon the turn of tarot cards, the predictions of “experts,” or the ebb and flow of business activity. The risks of being out of the game are huge compared to the risks of being in it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSo how does our attractive float affect the calculations of intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s book value is calculated, the full amount of our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and were unable to replenish it. But that’s an incorrect way to look at float, which should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. If float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe Berkshire’s will be, the true value of this liability is dramatically less than the accounting liability.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA partial offset to this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of “goodwill” that is attributable to our insurance companies and included in book value as an asset. In effect, this goodwill represents the price we paid for the float generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has no bearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance business sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFortunately, that’s not the case at Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our insurance goodwill – what we would happily pay to purchase an insurance operation producing float of similar quality – to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. The value of our float is one reason – a huge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e(Our definition of coverage is pre-tax earnings/interest, not EBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as deeply flawed.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges.

At some point in the future – though not, in my view, for a long time – GEICO’s premium volume may shrink because of driverless cars. This development could hurt our auto dealerships as well. Circulation of our print newspapers will continue to fall, a certainty we allowed for when\npurchasing them. To date, renewables have helped our utility operation but that could change, particularly if storage capabilities for electricity materially improve. Online retailing threatens the business model of our retailers and certain of our consumer brands. These potentialities are just a few of the negative possibilities facing us – but even the most casual follower of business news has long been aware of them.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNone of these problems, however, is crucial to Berkshire’s long-term well-being. When we took over the company in 1965, its risks could have been encapsulated in a single sentence: “The northern textile business in which all of our capital resides is destined for recurring losses and will eventually disappear.” That development, however, was no death knell. We simply adapted. And we will continue to do so.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere is, however, one clear, present and enduring danger to Berkshire against which Charlie and I are  powerless. That threat to Berkshire is also the major threat our citizenry faces: a “successful” (as defined by the aggressor) cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack on the United States. That is a risk Berkshire shares with all of American business.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eClimate change bears a similarity to Pascal’s Wager on the Existence of God. Pascal, it may be recalled, argued that if there were only a tiny probability that God truly existed, it made sense to behave as if He did because the rewards could be infinite whereas the lack of belief risked eternal misery. Likewise, if there is only a 1% chance the planet is heading toward a truly major disaster and delay means passing a point of no return, inaction now is foolhardy. Call this Noah’s Law: If an ark may be essential for survival, begin building it today, no matter how cloudless the skies appear.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWebcast of Annual meeting\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMy friend, Phil Beuth, has written \u003cem\u003eLimping on Water\u003c/em\u003e, an autobiography that chronicles his life at Capital Cities Communications and tells you a lot about its leaders, Tom Murphy and Dan Burke. These two were the best managerial duo – both in what they accomplished and how they did it – that Charlie and I ever witnessed. Much of what you become in life depends on whom you choose to admire and copy. Start with Tom Murphy, and you’ll never need a second exemplar\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"2016\"\u003e2016\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSome years, the gains in underlying earning power we achieve will be minor; very occasionally, the cash register will ring loud. Charlie and I have no magic plan to add earnings except to dream big and to be prepared mentally and financially to act fast when opportunities present themselves. Every decade or so, dark clouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it’s\nimperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou need not be an economist to understand how well our system has worked. Just look around you. See the 75 million owner-occupied homes, the bountiful farmland, the 260 million vehicles, the hyper-productive factories, the great medical centers, the talent-filled universities, you name it – they all represent a net gain for Americans from the barren lands, primitive structures and meager output of 1776. Starting from scratch, America\nhas amassed wealth totaling $90 trillion.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDuring such scary periods, you should never forget two things: First, widespread fear is your friend as an investor, because it serves up bargain purchases. Second, personal fear is your enemy. It will also be unwarranted. Investors who avoid high and unnecessary costs and simply sit for an extended period with a collection of large, conservatively-financed American businesses will almost certainly do well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eToo many managements – and the number seems to grow every year – are looking for any means to report, and indeed feature, “adjusted earnings” that are higher than their company’s GAAP earnings. There are many ways for practitioners to perform this legerdemain. Two of their favorites are the omission of “restructuring costs” and “stock-based compensation” as expenses.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCharlie and I want managements, in their commentary, to describe unusual items – good or bad – that affect the GAAP numbers. After all, the reason we look at these numbers of the past is to make estimates of the future. But a management that regularly attempts to wave away very real costs by highlighting “adjusted per-share earnings” makes us nervous. That’s because bad behavior is contagious: CEOs who overtly look for ways to report high numbers tend to foster a culture in which subordinates strive to be “helpful” as well\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo say “stock-based compensation” is not an expense is even more cavalier. CEOs who go down that road are, in effect, saying to shareholders, “If you pay me a bundle in options or restricted stock, don’t worry about its effect on earnings. I’ll ‘adjust’ it away.”\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen a company grows and outstanding shares shrink, good things happen for shareholders.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBut we have made no commitment that Berkshire will hold any of its marketable securities forever.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe bottom line: When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients. Both large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"2017\"\u003e2017\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAfter stating those fiscal facts, I would prefer to turn immediately to discussing Berkshire’s operations. But, in still another interruption, I must first tell you about a new accounting rule – a generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) – that in future quarterly and annual reports will severely distort Berkshire’s net income figures and very often mislead commentators and investors. The new rule says that the net change in unrealized investment gains and losses in stocks we hold must be included in all net income figures we report to you\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe ample availability of extraordinarily cheap debt in 2017 further fueled purchase activity. After all, even a high-priced deal will usually boost per-share earnings if it is debt-financed. \u003cem\u003eDon’t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOur aversion to leverage has dampened our returns over the years. But Charlie and I sleep well. Both of us believe it is insane to risk what you have and need in order to obtain what you don’t need. We held this view 50 years ago when we each ran an investment partnership, funded by a few friends and relatives who trusted us. We also hold it today after a million or so “partners” have joined us at Berkshire.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe less the prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we must conduct our own\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe were able to make one sensible stand-alone purchase last year, a 38.6% partnership interest in Pilot Flying J (“PFJ”). With about $20 billion in annual volume, the company is far and away the nation’s leading travel-center operator.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCharlie and I never will operate Berkshire in a manner that depends on the kindness of strangers – or even that of friends who may be facing liquidity problems of their own. During the 2008-2009 crisis, we liked having Treasury Bills – loads of Treasury Bills – that protected us from having to rely on funding sources such as bank lines or commercial paper\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period. Even if your borrowings are small and your positions aren’t immediately threatened by the plunging market, your mind may well become rattled by scary headlines and breathless commentary. And an unsettled mind will not make good decisions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen major declines occur, however, they offer extraordinary opportunities to those who are not handicapped by debt. That’s the time to heed these lines from Kipling’s If:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-yaml\" data-lang=\"yaml\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#ae81ff\"\u003e“If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs . . .\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#ae81ff\"\u003eIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting . . .\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#ae81ff\"\u003eIf you can think – and not make thoughts your aim . . .\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#ae81ff\"\u003eIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you...\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#ae81ff\"\u003eYours is the Earth and everything that’s in it.”\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIndex fund vs Hedge Fund bet - Lesson that Indexing works(Performance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn November 2012, as we were considering all this, the cash return from dividends on the S\u0026amp;P 500 was 21⁄2% annually, about triple the yield on our U.S. Treasury bond. These dividend payments were almost certain to grow. Beyond that, huge sums were being retained by the companies comprising the 500. These businesses would use their retained earnings to expand their operations and, frequently, to repurchase their shares as well. Either course would, over time, substantially increase earnings-per-share. And – as has been the case since 1776 – whatever its problems of the minute, the American economy was going to move forward.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInvesting is an activity in which consumption today is foregone in an attempt to allow greater consumption at a later date. “Risk” is the possibility that this objective won’t be attained. By that standard, purportedly “risk-free” long-term bonds in 2012 were a far riskier investment than a long term investment in common stocks. At that time, even a 1% annual rate of inflation between 2012 and 2017 would have decreased the purchasing-power of the government bond that Protégé and I sold.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI want to quickly acknowledge that in any upcoming day, week or even year, stocks will be riskier – far riskier – than short-term U.S. bonds. As an investor’s investment horizon lengthens, however, a diversified portfolio of U.S. equities becomes progressively less risky than bonds, assuming that the stocks are purchased at a sensible multiple of earnings relative to then-prevailing interest rates.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons – among them, pension funds, college endowments and savings-minded individuals – to measure their investment “risk” by their portfolio’s ratio of bonds to stocks. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"2018\"\u003e2018\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWide swings in our quarterly GAAP earnings will inevitably continue. That’s because our huge equity portfolio – valued at nearly $173 billion at the end of 2018 – will often experience one-day price fluctuations of $2 billion or more\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe fact is that the annual change in Berkshire’s book value – is a metric that has lost the relevance it once had. Three circumstances have made that so.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFirst, Berkshire has gradually morphed from a company whose assets are concentrated in marketable stocks into one whose major value resides in operating businesses. Charlie and I expect that reshaping to continue in an irregular manner.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSecond, while our equity holdings are valued at market prices, accounting rules require our collection of operating companies to be included in book value at an amount far below their current value, a mismark that has grown in recent years.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThird, it is likely that – over time – Berkshire will be a significant repurchaser of its shares, transactions that will take place at prices above book value but below our estimate of intrinsic value. The math of such purchases is simple: Each transaction makes per-share intrinsic value go up, while per-share book value goes down. That combination causes the book-value scorecard to become increasingly out of touch with economic reality\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDespite our recent additions to marketable equities, the most valuable grove in Berkshire’s forest remains the many dozens of non-insurance businesses that Berkshire controls (usually with 100% ownership and never with less than 80%). Those subsidiaries earned $16.8 billion last year.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAbraham Lincoln once posed the question: \u003cem\u003e“If you call a dog’s tail a leg, how many legs does it have?” and then answered his own query: “Four, because calling a tail a leg doesn’t make it one.” Abe would have felt lonely on Wall Street.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBerkshire’s runner-up grove by value is its collection of equities, typically involving a 5% to 10% ownership position in a very large company. As noted earlier, our equity investments were worth nearly $173 billion at year end, an amount far above their cost. If the portfolio had been sold at its year end valuation, federal income tax of about $14.7 billion would have been payable on the gain. In all likelihood, we will hold most of these stocks for a long time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA third category of Berkshire’s business ownership is a quartet of companies in which we share control with other parties. Our portion of the after-tax operating earnings of these businesses – 26.7% of Kraft Heinz, 50% of Berkadia and Electric Transmission Texas, and 38.6% of Pilot Flying J – totaled about $1.3 billion in 2018\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn our fourth grove, Berkshire held $112 billion at year end in U.S. Treasury bills and other cash equivalents, and another $20 billion in miscellaneous fixed-income instruments. We consider a portion of that stash to be untouchable, having pledged to always hold at least $20 billion in cash equivalents to guard against external calamities. We have also promised to avoid any activities that could threaten our maintaining that buffer.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePrices are sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects. At Berkshire, the whole is greater – considerably greater – than the sum of the parts.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI believe Berkshire’s intrinsic value can be approximated by summing the values of our four asset-laden groves and then subtracting an appropriate amount for taxes eventually payable on the sale of marketable securities.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInsurance is the next grove\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOn occasion, a ridiculously-high purchase price for a given stock will cause a splendid business to become a poor investment – if not permanently, at least for a painfully long period. Over time, however, investment performance converges with business performance\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAmerican TailWind\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"2019\"\u003e2019\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn 1924, Edgar Lawrence Smith, an obscure economist and financial advisor, wrote Common Stocks as Long Term Investments, a slim book that changed the investment world - Power of retained earnings\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eToday, school children learn what Keynes termed “novel”: combining savings with compound interest works wonders.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDuring the past decade, Berkshire’s depreciation charges have aggregated $65 billion whereas the company’s internal investments in property, plant and equipment have totaled $121 billion. Reinvestment in productive operational assets will forever remain our top priority.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e17.5 billion from non insurance, Lubrizol insurance cost to berkshire. \u003cem\u003e“Let not the left hand know what the right hand doeth.”\u003c/em\u003e - so only 400 million in gain from insurance. 17 years \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 27.5 Billion in underwriting profit + float\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhat we can say is that if something close to current rates should prevail over the coming decades and if corporate tax rates also remain near the low level businesses now enjoy, it is almost certain that equities will over time perform far better than long-term, fixed-rate debt instruments. That rosy prediction comes with a warning: Anything can happen to stock prices tomorrow. Occasionally, there will be major drops in the market, perhaps of 50% magnitude or even greater. But the combination of The American Tailwind, about which I wrote last year, and the compounding wonders described by Mr. Smith, will make equities the much better long-term choice for the individual who does not use borrowed money and who can control his or her emotions.
